## Macroeconomics basic concepts 

### Introduction to macroeconomics
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113201916.png)

#### Takeaways
- Economy is the science that seeks to predict human behavior with respect to resources
- Normative vs Positive statements
- Command economy vs Market Economy
- Capital is already-produced goods
- Economists model people with assumptions such as rationality

#### Quotes
> Any economic system must provide society with a means of making choices that answer three basic questions:
	-   What will be produced with society’s limited resources?
	-   How will we produce the things we need and want?
	-   How will society’s output be distributed?

#### Interesting questions

### Opportunity cost and the Production Possibilities Curve
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113203001.png)

#### Keywords
- Ceterus parabus (all variables are equal)
- Production possibilities frontier (PPF)
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113203539.png)

#### Takeaways
- Production possibilities frontier usually looks like the top right quarter of a circle. In the picture above we see a non linear negative correlation between the X and Y variable, i.e. you get diminishing returns on decreasing your X variable

#### Formulas
$$Opportunity\;cost\;of\;each\;unit\;of\;good\; X=(Y1−Y2)÷(X1−X2)\;units\;of\;good\;Y$$


### Comparitive advantage and the gains from trade
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113214501.png)

#### Keywords
- Absolute vs Relative comparative advantage
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113214559.png)
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221113230843.png)

#### Takeaways
- To calculate opportunity cost just take two points from the function and equate them to each other and solve for a variable

![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221126191115.png)
- We usually want to maximize the amount of things we have, using trade to increase our efficiency
- Trading is useless sometimes

Good luck understanding this


### Demand
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221123165826.png)

#### Takeaways
- Demand: Price -> Quantity demanded
- Price and quantity demanded are negatevly correlated
- Quantity demanded != demand

#### Interesting questions
- "An increase in the number of buyers of a good" does not specify X, hence BAD question

### Supply
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221125151813.png)

#### Takeaways
- Supply: Price -> Quantity supplied
- Price and quantity supplied tend to be positively correlated
- Quantity supplied != supply


### Markets
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221125151941.png)

#### Takeaways
- Market equilibrium happens when quantity supplied == quantity demanded
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221125153041.png) 
- I still don't understand/agree with the fundemental assumption of the supply law. I know a supplier seeks to maximize their revenue by increasing quantity supplied but they could anticipate the surplus production they'll end up with and just stop, i.e. point (1, 3.75) in the graph

## Economic indicators and the business cycle


### Gross Domestic Product
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221126191304.png)

#### Takeaways
- The definiton of GDP given in the picture
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221126191211.png)
- Final means if a good is a prerequisite to another good then it must not be counted to avoid over counting
- Nationality does not matter, if its produced in country X then its part of X's GDP
- GNP is Gross National Product, which is nationality specific rather than 
- [GDP per capita all countries 1990 - 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/gdp-)
- [NICE classification of goods](https://github.com/kemitchell/nice-classification.json)
- Investment Vs. Consumption
	- Investment: All the spending by firms + houses individuals buy (What a weirdly specific exception)
	- Consumption: All the spending by individuals on final goods and services - houses individuals buy (What a weirdly specific exception) 
- Used goods are NOT counted. Intermediate goods are NOT counted
- [Wages are NOT counted under the expenditure approach](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/39956)
- Buying stocks is NOT counted since its a transfer of goods

#### Formulas
$$GDP=I+C+G+NX$$
Where
- I: Investments (see [[Macroeconomoics#Gross Domestic Product#Takeaways) for definiton)
- C: Consumption (see [[Macroeconomoics#Gross Domestic Product#Takeaways) for definiton)
- G: Goverment spending on all final goods and services 
- NX = values of exported goods - value of imported goods


### Limitations of GDP
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221129211148.png)

#### Definitons

> -   **Gross national product**, or **GNP**, includes what is produced domestically and what is produced by domestic labor and business abroad in a year. 
	-   **National income** includes all income earned: wages, profits, rent, and profit income.    
	-   **Net national product**, or **NNP**, is GNP minus depreciation.
	-   **Depreciation** is the process by which capital ages over time and therefore loses its value.

#### Takeaways
- GDP can be used as a factor in a number of different indicators. E.g. GDP per capita, Purchase Power Parity, etc. etc. etc. etc.
- Comparing GNP and GDP can be used to indicate where citzens of a particular country make money
- `GDP does not account for leisure time. The US GDP per capita is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, but does this prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily since it is also true that the average US worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average German worker. The calculation of GDP does not take German workers extra weeks of vacation into account.`
- `GDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP.`
- `GDP also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does not care whether they are all white bread or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others—GDP just looks at whether the total amount spent on bread is the same.` <- Is there's an indicator for this
- The [Human Development Index (HDI)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) is cool


#### TODO
- [ ] Look into Purchase Power Parity
- [ ] Look into GNP of countries of workers that come to the middle east
- [ ] Look into indicators of money inequality in countries, maybe human development index?
- [ ] Look into a dataset with as many indicators as possible


#### Unemployment
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221129215646.png)

#### Takeaways
- P: Population
	- L: Legally able to work
		- WL: Working or looking for work recently 
			- W: Looking for work recently <- Unemployed
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221129215733.png)
- Unemployment is usually calculated by surveys
- WEIRD things happen when W give up and become part of L, or suddenly L - WL want to work
- Good luck understanding the set theory gibberish
- NRU: Natural rate of unemployment (noisy, e.g. per 4 weeks) 
- UR: Unemployment rate (smooth, e.g. averaged)

#### Formulas
$$Unemployment\_rate = W / WL$$
$$Cyclical\_unemployment = UR - NRU$$


#### Inflation
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221129220751.png)

#### Definitons
- **Inflation**: `a sustained increase in the overall price level in the economy, which reduces the purchasing power of the currency`
	- The increase in price level can be attributed to many many factors, here are some of them
		- The money supply is larger than the value created
		- `Goods supply shocks`
		- Increases in price levels (snowball effect)
- **Deflation**: -Inflation
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: `an index that calculates the cost of a market basket of goods purchased by a typical family that lives in an urban area; the purpose of the CPI is to track changes in the cost of living over time.`
	- CPI is a proxy used to measure inflation
- **Core Inflation Index**: `is a measure of inflation typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables such as food and energy prices to better measure the underlying and persistent trend in long-term prices.`

#### Takeaways
- Inflation is calculated by CPI, which is calculated by tracking the price of a basket of goods
	- Important remarks
		- `A fixed, unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes—not a very likely assumption. _Substitution bias_ tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.`
		- Taking these arguments together, the _quality/new goods bias_ means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods and the invention of new goods improve the standard of living.
- Amazing open source content! https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/394
- A supply shock can cause stagflation which is beautifully portraid by the following graph (start from supply going down), economic death spirals are scary! ![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221129234225.png)
- Deflationary spirals cause hoarding
	- How can this be controlled? what are the avenues for goverments to drive inflation up and down

#### High inflation problems
> Economists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages, so they reason that, on average over time, people’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of Funny Money, then no one’s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended redistributions of purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.


1. Unintended redistributions of purchasing power

> Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation include those who are holding a lot of cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash is diminished. But cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.

2. Blurred price signals
3. Problems of long-term planning
4. ![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221204211942.png)source: [Crash course on economic crashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHw4NStQsT8)  

#### Critical-thinking questions

> Inflation rates, like most statistics, are imperfect measures. Can you identify some ways that the inflation rate for fruit does not perfectly capture the rising price of fruit?`
1. CPI-U is weighted towards the average consumer, assuming the average consumer's consumption distribution of fruits is not uniform, we can expect bias in the inflation rates
	1. E.g. Consumers only eat bananas, all fruits increase in price except bananas which dont change prices, inflation is constant
2. Inflation does not account for the differences in quality of a good over time, this is due to the rigid classification of goods
3. Exercise for the reader

> If, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast as inflation, why do people worry about how inflation affects incomes?

Since people have other sources of value different from salary, such as savings or assets that don't grow with inflation, the purchasing power of those sources of value will lose diminitsh due to inflation

> Who in an economy is the big winner from inflation?

Loanees

#### TODO
- [ ] The graph above reminds of markov chains. Look into economic models using markov chains
- [ ] Look into the avenues for goverments to drive inflation up and down (I know one, changing interest rates on loans)
- [ ] How exactly does inflation happen? how are the prices raised?


### Costs of Inflation
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221205000809.png)

### Real GDP and nominal GDP

#### Takeaways
- Problem with nominal GDP 
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221205001450.png)
  - This is why Real GDP adjusts by calculating GDP based on the reference point's prices
- Real GDP is hard to measure irl, need to adjust nominal GDP by inflation to get real GDP

#### Formulas
$$ NGDP / RGDP = CPI_1 / CPI_2$$
$$NGDP * CPI_1 / CPI_2 = RGDP$$

#### Review questions
> What is the difference between a series of economic data over time measured in nominal terms versus the same data series over time measured in real terms?

Nominal terms: the data is measured relative to it's period's prices
Real terms: the data is measured relative to a reference point's prices

> How do you convert a series of nominal economic data over time to real terms?

You adjust for inflation using the formula above

#### Critical thinking question

Should people typically pay more attention to their real income or their nominal income? If you choose the latter, why would that make sense in today’s world? Would your answer be the same for the 1970s?

Real income, both times. Since it represents one's purchasing power. Am I missing something

#### Common misperceptions:
> An increase in GDP does not necessarily mean a nation has produced more output; it must be specified whether the GDP in question is nominal or real. An increase in nominal GDP may just mean prices have increased, while an increase in real GDP definitely means output increased.


### Business cycles
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221207223743.png)

#### Takeaways
- The emotional aspect of markets is not captured by traditional economic models
- People tend to over-invest when the recent past was positive and vice verse when the recent past was negative![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221207224512.png)
	![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221207224457.png)
- Real GDP is an indicator of the business cycle
- Real GDP is highely correlated with people's emotions about the market

#### Critical thinking questions

> Why do you suppose that US GDP is so much higher today than 50 or 100 years ago?

Two reasons:
1. More people 
   ![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221207230155.png)
   2. Productivity per worker increased due to technology, processes, IQ? (are people getting smarter? if yes then it's a slow change)
 
> Why do you think that GDP does not grow at a steady rate, but rather speeds up and slows down?

This question is very hard

Here's an example cycle of investment in a successful firm
1. Firm starts getting investment
2. Firm produces value
3. Firm get more investment (investors miscalculate real value of a firm, related topic [[Random notes to be organized#PE ratio)) (Spending goes UP, GDP goes UP)
4. Firm eventually cannot keep up producing value and starts falling short of investment goals
5. Investors pull out (Spending goes DOWN, GDP goes DOWN)

What I don't understand is why wouldnt the example above average out over many firms? why do entire economies go through cycles?

Too stupid of a section


### Automatic stabalizers

#### Takeaways
- The goverment can automatically dampen the volatility of the business cycle by setting laws and regulations that smoothes the business cycle curve. For example Taxes, welfare and unemployment

## Financial sector

### Financial assets
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210145737.png)

#### Takeaways
- Interest: "Rent on money" -Sal Khan
- Interest types
	 Given money rented $M$, *interest rate* $I$, rent is paid every period $P$ and there are $N$ periods to pay money owed $R$
	- Simple: $$R = M + I * N$$
	- Compound: $$R = MI^N$$
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210150239.png)
[Image source](https://learn.financestrategists.com/finance-terms/compound-interest/)
- Bonds: Crowdfunded loans. A certificate you buy that gives you a fixed interest (called a coupon) every period (e.g. Quartely, Semi-yearly, Yearly) and your money is returned after a set time
  ![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210163445.png) (ignore stuff top left)
  - Paying Bondees takes priority to shareholders, as bonds are liability and not equity
  - Bonds can be bought and sold
  - Bond prices are affected by the current interest rate for new bonds
  - [Excellent guide on bonds](https://europe.pimco.com/en-eu/resources/education/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bonds#:~:text=The%20corporation%20%E2%80%93%20now%20referred%20to,principal%2C%20or%20the%20%241%20million.)
> Bond investors can choose from many different investment strategies, depending on the role or roles that bonds will play in their investment portfolios.
>
> Passive investment strategies include buying and holding bonds until maturity and investing in bond funds or portfolios that track bond indexes. Passive approaches may suit investors seeking some of the traditional benefits of bonds, such as capital preservation, income and diversification, but they do not attempt to capitalize on the interest rate, credit or market environment.
>
> Active investment strategies, by contrast, try to outperform bond indexes, often by buying and selling bonds to take advantage of price movements. They have the potential to provide many or all of the benefits of bonds; however, to outperform indexes successfully over the long term, active investing requires the ability to: 1) form opinions on the economy, the direction of interest rates and/or the credit environment; 2) trade bonds efficiently to express those views; and 3) manage risk.
- $$Assets=Liability + Equity$$![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210165626.png)
- Shares: A part of a company's equity
- Assuming a company has 2m shares, and \$20m of equity then we calcualte a share's value like so![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210170006.png)$$Share\_price = equity/num(shares)$$
- Example balance sheet

- Example end of day report of the stock market (BTW, Market Cap is $Last\_trade * num\_shares$) ![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210174134.png)

#### Lesson Summary
> What if you woke up one day and discovered you won $10000? What are you going to do with this new-found wealth? Spend it? Save it? If you decide to save it, then you are participating in the **financial system**.
>
> The purpose of the financial system is to connect savers and borrowers. Savers store their wealth in ways that let them earn a return. Borrowers want to pursue projects, but they need money (from savers) to fund those projects. For example, if a firm wants to build a new factory, they might issue **bonds** and **stocks** to savers as a way to raise **financial assets** and get **real assets**. When borrowers buy those stocks and bonds, they are effectively lending money to these firms.


## Nominal v. real interest rates
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210180148.png)

#### Takeaways
- Real interest rate is inflation adjusted, nominal isn't
-  `A payment is said to be **indexed** if it is automatically adjusted for inflation.`
-  `An **adjustable-rate mortgage** is a loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with market interest rates.`
-  `**Cost-of-living adjustments** are a contractual provision that wage increases will keep up with inflation.` Apparently decreasing wages lessens the inflation rate, therefore indexing wages might worsen inflation
- real interest rate = nominal interest rate − inflation
  
### Definition, measurement, and functions of money
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221210190250.png)

#### Takeaways
- Fractional reserve banking: Banks lending a portion of the money reserved in them to people for it to be spent on the economy
- Money supply (volume of all money), can be defined in three ways
	- M0: All cash
	- M1: M1 + fractional reserve banking money
	- M2: Nearly liquid assets, `financial assets that aren’t directly used for a medium of exchange, but can be converted into cash or a checking account`
	- Video explaining them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM
- Double coincidences of wants
- Functions of money
	1. Medium of exchange
	2. Store of value | Inflation affects this negatively, is there's an indicator of regression of this function
	3. Unit of value | Inflation ruins this slightely or massively
1. Commodity money and fiat money might not be so different, both have the 3 functions of money

### Banking and the expansion of the money supply![[Pasted image 20221220202732.png]]

#### Takeaways
- Central bank is what prints money (among other responsibilities)
- In fractional reserve systems the bank can and will write checks and lend money to 3rd parties (1st is bank, 2nd is lender) as long as they have a fractional reserve as legislated by the law
- How to calculate fractional reserve impact of some money, assuming banks reserve a constant percentage of that money![[Pasted image 20221220204424.png]]
- Run on banks! You can ensure against it where the central banks pays everything the bank does not have![[Pasted image 20221220204653.png]]
- Fractional reserve is unstable, handle with care
- Fractional reserve is benefitial to customers since they can use banking services for free
- Full reserve is what it sounds like, and the services aren't gonna be free
