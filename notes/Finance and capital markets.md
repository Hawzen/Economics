## Housing

### Home equity and personal balance sheets
![[Pasted image 20221221214519.png]]

#### Takeaways
- Assets = Liabilities - Equity
- Balance sheets vs Financial sheets
```
A financial statement includes more information than a balance sheet does. A balance sheet contains the following information:

-   Assets: Any assets the business holds, including cash and cash equivalents, investments, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses
    
-   Liabilities: How the business finances its assets, such as loans and debts, income taxes and accrued expenses
    
-   Shareholder equity: The money left for shareholders if the business repaid all its debts. This information is usually divided into equity capital and retained earnings.
    

A financial statement includes a balance sheet but also includes the following information:

-   Income statement: Showing revenue, costs and expenses incurred during the financial period
    
-   Cash flow statement: Showing cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving the company

- Accrual income statements try to factor time out of the equation and provide a better view profits a place has
- Accounts receivable (AR) is the money you're owed. (Accounts payable is the inverse, it's not showing in the graph)
- Heres a graph of Cash and accrual techniques side by side
![[Pasted image 20221231003407.png]]
- Three major financial statements
	- Balance sheets are snapshots of assets and liabilities
	- Income statements are income statements over a given period
	- Cash flow statement describes differences in starting cash and ending cash, net income, AR increase
![[Pasted image 20221231004432.png]]
- When evaluating assets after some period of time has passed you have two options
	- Historical cost which evaluates assets based on their historical price
	- Fair value in which an appraiser evaluates your assets based on the market. This is usually preferred
![[Pasted image 20221231004830.png]]

### Depreciation and amortization
![[Pasted image 20221231005100.png]]


#### Takeaways
- Depreciation is a way to spread out the cost of an assets over it's life span, to make balance sheets make more sense and convey the stability of a business. Pic 1 without depreciation, pic 2 with
![[Pasted image 20221231010823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20221231010847.png]]
- Amortization is similar to depreciation, but often used with intangible assets like fees and licenses


## Stocks and bonds
![[Pasted image 20221231011216.png]]

#### Takeaways
- Shorting
	- Shorting stocks is a practice which involves predicting a stock's gonna fall so you borrow that stock then sell it when it eventually goes low  
	- Regular investing follows buy low sell high, short selling follows borrow high sell low
	- Shorting can be benefitial for the economy as volatility of the stock will decrease since shorters (?) will add stock liquidity when price is high and demand when the price is low
	- Shorting can be very dangerous for the shroter since it has unlimited potential cost if the analysis does not play out a la game stop situation

- Income statement
  - Parsed from top to bottom
	  - Start with total revenue then subtract expenditures to get the next number in the section below (terrible explaination)
	  - In the statement parathesied numbers are expenditures, real income statements might not do that
	  - The two income statements shown differ in debt
  - Capital structure refers to the distribution of their assets from liabiltiies to equity. We can see that Ben's capital structure is more equity which is better for him probably
![[Pasted image 20221231182027.png]]
- Markets can still buy stock with more than earning per share (EPS), in that case investors think there's an intangible asset that has not been counted such as benefitial future market shifts or company expertise, in that case buying for more than EPS might be a good idea. This case often happens with real companies
- This is Market Capitalization vs. Book Capitalization
- A good indicator of that difference is the PE ratio $PE = Stock Price / EPS$
	- Always ask what are the earnings used? are they historical annual earnings? are they averaged earnings? etc.
	- PE from different industries are not compareable  
	- Related concept: Forward Earning, this is a prediction of the EPS based on some analysis
```## Why P/E Ratio is important?

The P/E ratio indirectly incorporates key fundamentals of the company such as future growth and risk. Generally, it takes into account the following factors:

**Past Performance:** If the company has a proven track record, it would have a higher P/E relative to a company that has had erratic performance.

**Future Growth:** This is the most important factor built into the P/E ratio. High growth companies (sales and earnings) will have higher P/E than the low growth companies within the same industry.

**Risk (Leverage):** P/E ratio is highly dependent on capital structure. Leverage (i.e. debt taken on by the company) affects both earnings and share price in a variety of ways, including the leveraging of earnings growth rates, tax effects, and impacts on the risk of bankruptcy, and can sometimes dramatically affect the company’s results. Thus, the lower the leverage, the higher the P/E ratio. As a result, the high capital intensive industry gets lower P/E than the low capital intensive industry.

**Corporate Governance:** A company with strong corporate governance will have a higher P/E than its peer group. For example, **[Infosys](http://www.moneyworks4me.com/indianstocks/large-cap/it-ites/it-software/infosys/analysis-and-overview "Infosys Ltd.")** has historically commanded higher P/E than its peer group because it has strong corporate governance.

**Dividend Pay-out:** Generally, high and stable dividend-paying companies get high P/E because it shows the fundamental strength of the company and the company’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders.

**Economic Cycle:** Industries that are affected by the economic cycle usually trade at lower P/E’s than defensive sectors (those which are unaffected by the economic cycle). For example, FMCG and Pharma sectors have higher P/E than the Textile and Capital Goods sectors.

- PE can be a bad tool when considering enterprises with a lot of non operating capital, a good alternatives might be Enterprise Value (EV) $EV = Mkt.Cap. + Debt - Cash$. Google why formula like this. Also Operating Profit (OP). Also EBITDA but I need to finish fast no description

- Interesting random idea: When does it make more sense to raise money from debt vs equity? debt interest might be tax deductable, pros cons etc.
- IPO = Initial Public Offering
- VC = Venture Capitalist
- Bankruptacy
	- Liquidation of all assets, done if the busines generates no value
	- Resturcturing of assets, done if the operating value is more than the liquid value and is voted and by capital holders
		- The company is re-evaluated and voted on then new debt and new equity are assigned to capital holders starting from the most senior ![[Pasted image 20230107001936.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230107002023.png]]
- Assets belong to the capital structure holders, debt then equity, and are organized in terms of seniority / priority ![[Pasted image 20230107000722.png]]
- Secured debt means it's linked with a collateral (e.g. Mortage)
- Stock dilution should be approved by the board
